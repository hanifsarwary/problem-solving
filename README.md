[problem 1](../master/Misc/problem1.py): This problem was asked by Microsoft.Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

[Problem 2](../master/Misc/problem2.py): This problem was asked by Google. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true

[problem 4](../master/Misc/problem-4.py): This Problem was asked by Google. Given a string, return the first recurring character in it, or null if there is no recurring character. For example, given the string "acbbac", return "b". Given the string "abcdef", return null.
